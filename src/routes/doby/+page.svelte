        "Oh, you studied how many years? Nice. But employers still want 5 years of experience for that entry-level job. Good luck cracking that stone, buddy.",
        "I sit around doing nothing all day and nobody cares. You try it, though, and they call it 'lack of ambition.' Funny world, huh?",
        "It's not about what you know or even who you know. It's more likeâ€¦ who your dad knows. Did you study that one?",
        "I am literally a rock, but I've had more callbacks than you. Maybe if you added 'sedimentary' to your LinkedIn skills, you'd get noticed too.",
        "So, you are waiting for a company to notice you. Hate to break it to you, but they might as well be waiting for me to grow feet.",
        "They say hard work pays off, but you work too hard, and they call it 'overqualified.' Too little, and they call it 'underqualified.' Meanwhile, here I am... perfectly unqualified for anything. Maybe youâ€™re overthinking this whole 'work' thing.",
        "You know what's funny? Employers say they want someone 'dynamic,' but they also want someone who'll sit still at a desk for eight hours. I mean, pick a lane, am I right?",
        "You think you are immovable in your career? Try being an actual rock. I still get further than some resumes do in the hiring process.",
        "They say, 'do not be a rock in your career path!' Yeah? Well, I've been sitting here, and no one's fired me yet.",
        "When you finally land an interview, but they ghost you? Welcome to my world, friend. We rocks call that 'a Tuesday.'",
        "Study all you want, but sometimes you've just gotta accept that some doors don't open without a rock-hard punchâ€¦ or nepotism. You got any family in HR?",
        "Every rejection is 'experience.' Too bad 'experience' doesn't buy you food or rent.",
        "Remember, rejection builds 'character.' But if you ask me, I'd rather be an empty character with a paycheck.",
        "Some companies want candidates to work for free to 'prove themselves.' Look, the only thing I've done for free is exist. That's where I draw the line."
